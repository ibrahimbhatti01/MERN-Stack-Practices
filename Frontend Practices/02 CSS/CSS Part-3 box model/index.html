      Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of
        York; And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of
        the ocean buried. Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; Our
        bruised arms hung up for monuments; Our stern alarums changed to merry
        meetings, Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. Grim-visaged war
        hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
