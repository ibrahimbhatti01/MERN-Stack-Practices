This is just a practice repo, in which I've learnt about:
- Get request (how the data requested by this request appears in url).
- Post request (secret credentials requested with this type are safe, and stay secret, and send in body in json).
- OOP (How object oriented programming works in javascript).
- Prototypes
- "new" operator
- Constructors
- Classes
- Keywords like (extends, super)
