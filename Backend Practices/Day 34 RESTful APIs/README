## RESTful APIs practice

In this repo I've practiced the concept of:
- Connecting Frontend and Backend
- Building live Backend Server
- CRUD operations
  - Create //POST request
  - Read //GET request
  - Update
    - //PUT -> (updates existing data)
    - //PATCH -> (updates existing data partially)
  - Delete //DELETE request

By developing a simple Website replicating Quora, How posts are created, deleted, and edited by sending different API request.

## Packages used
- npm ***UUID package*** (for generating random id's)
- npm ***method-override*** (for overriding the get and post methods of html forms with, other type of requests.)
